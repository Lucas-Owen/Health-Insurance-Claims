# Health-Insurance-Claims
An api and endpoint to manage filing health insurance claims between a health insurance company and a health provider.

Claims folder contains the api done in java using spring boot, the end point is still under development (currently learning react) and will be uploaded soon :)

When it's done, the health provider will be able to login and fill a form that is representative of the claim form, and accompanying invoices which shall be submitted to the insurance company for review and payment. 

New features will be added with time
